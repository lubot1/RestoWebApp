## References
While making this web application I referenced Christine Bittle's [Varsity Project MVP](https://github.com/christinebittle/varsity_mvp). I referenced the Controllers folder to setup my controllers, and the Models folder to setup my models so I could create my database successfully. I also referenced Christine Bittle's [Many-to-Many repo](https://github.com/christinebittle/EF_Many_Many_Explicit) to add an explicit many-to-many relationship to my Owners and restaurants table.
